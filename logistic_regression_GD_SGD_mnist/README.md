Binary logistic regression tries to classify between two classes of digits (2 and 7 in our case). The script includes gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and batch gradient descent.  
Multinomial logistic regression tries to discriminate between all 10 digit classes. This script uses two classification methods to accomplish this. One is MSE Loss, the other one is softmax with negative log-likelihood function.
