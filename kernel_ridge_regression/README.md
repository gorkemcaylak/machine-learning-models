This model applies kernel ridge regression on randomly generated data. It uses polynomial kernel k_poly(x,y) = (1+x^Ty)^d and RBF kernel k_rbf(x,y) = exp(-gamma|x-y|^2) with d and gamma as hyper-parameters. The script uses leave-one-out cross-validation for the smaller dataset (n=30) and k-fold cross-validation for the larger one (n=300) to tune the hyper-parameters. Prediction is plotted with respect to the real values.
Second part applies bootstrapping by sampling the data with replacement to get the 95% and 5% confidency intervals.
